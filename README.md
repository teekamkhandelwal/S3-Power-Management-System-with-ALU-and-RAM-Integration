# S3 Power Management System with ALU and RAM Integration
## Overview
This project demonstrates an efficient system integrating an ALU module functioning as a simplified processor, a RAM module for storing operation data, and advanced power management to handle transitions between active, idle, and S3 power states. The system optimizes energy consumption through intelligent idle detection, multi-level power-down flows, and seamless operation recovery upon exiting power-save modes.

## Features
ALU Operations:
1.Supports ADD, SUB, AND, and OR operations.
