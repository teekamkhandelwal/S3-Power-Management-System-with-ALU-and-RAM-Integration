# S3 Power Management System with ALU and RAM Integration

## **Overview**
This project demonstrates an efficient system integrating an ALU module functioning as a simplified processor, a RAM module for storing operation data, and advanced power management to handle transitions between active, idle, and S3 power states. The system optimizes energy consumption through intelligent idle detection, multi-level power-down flows, and seamless operation recovery upon exiting power-save modes.

---

## **Features**
1. **ALU Operations**:
   - Supports ADD, SUB, AND, and OR operations.
   - Saves ongoing operations and results to RAM during S3 mode.
   - Restores operations and results from RAM upon exiting S3 mode.

2. **RAM Storage**:
   - Stores operation inputs, results, and operation codes during S3 mode.
   - Seamless retrieval of stored data after exiting S3 mode.

3. **S3 Power Management**:
   - Detects idle states after 10 ns and enables clock gating.
   - Initiates multi-level power-down flow:
     - Assert reset.
     - Deassert isolation clamp.
     - Enter power-down mode.
   - Exits power-down flow:
     - Assert power-up.
     - Assert isolation clamp.
     - Deassert reset.

4. **Idle Handling**:
   - Triggers power-saving modes during prolonged idle states.
   - Restarts operations upon exiting idle.

## **Flow Diagram**
The system operates as follows:

1. **ALU performs operations** based on inputs (`A`, `B`, and `Opcode`).
2. **RAM stores ALU operations** during S3 mode.
3. **Power Management detects idle states**:
   - Enables clock gating after 10 ns of idleness.
   - Initiates 3-stage power-down flow after prolonged idle.
4. **S3 State Transitions**:
   - Saves ALU state to RAM upon entering S3 mode.
   - Restores ALU state upon exiting S3 mode.
